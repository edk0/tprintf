tprintf is a printf implementation (or will be, once it isn't missing
floating-point conversion specifiers).

Things are generally quite extensible; see tprintf.h for the interface.
Implementations of the standard C conversion specifiers can be found in
tstd.c.
Examples of most of this - including an example of a custom conversion
specifier - are in example.c.

The %n$ notation is not supported. I don't think it ever will be.
